        <h2>Box 1</h2>

            This is the first box. It has a light blue background, rounded corners, and a solid border. 
            This box includes an image below to enhance the visual appeal of the content. 
            The image should be relevant to the content described and help illustrate the point.

    <section class ="box2">
        <h2>Box 2</h2>
        <p>
            This is the second box. It has a light orange background, slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow. 
            Including an image in this box helps break up the text and provides a visual example of the content. 
            The use of CSS box shadow enhances the 3D effect of this box.

        <p>
            This is the third box. 
            It has a light purple background, no rounded corners, and a dashed border. 
            This box also includes an image, which helps to demonstrate how different 
            styles and borders can be applied to create distinct visual sections within a webpage.
